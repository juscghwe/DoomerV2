I started this project as a homework for university.
Due to time (~6 weeks) and developing skills it wasn't perfect at all but I want to grow on it.
Therefore I'm going to develop it further.

Feel free to help out if you want to.

I don't own or declare rights on this project.
/images/fillings/titelkarte.png is made with Amazdoom Font and the background is based on freeimages.com/de/photo/technology-background-1632715
/images/gameobjects/despawn.png is a slightly adjusted image of rigeshop.com/content/profiles/25/25.png
I'm going to adjust these images over time to self drawn.
